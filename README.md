Final Project - Weather station Embedded System
-----------
This project consist of the implementation of a Weather station that uses a machine learning algorithm to determine the next temperature and humidity. The main objective is to reduce energy waste and environmental impact.
The system is divided in three main components. First component is a embedded system inside of a Raspberry Pi, which is responsible for data acquisition and processing. Second is a host computer, responsible for storing a event log sent by the embedded system and displaying this information. Third is a host smartphone, with the same responsibilities as the host computer but using wireless to acquire and send data. The three of them are developed using C++ with an object-oriented developing, designed to be easily adaptable to different weather station system manufacturers and operating systems.
